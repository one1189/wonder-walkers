        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Wonder Walkers is an organisation helping to get people exploring the great outdoors, once again. The organisation was inspired by the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wonder-Walkers-Archer/dp/0593109643" target="_blank" aria-label="Link to 'Wonder Walkers' book by Micha Archer Amazon page" >The Wonder Walkers by Micha Archer</a></p>
        <p>Growing up as a child, the book inspired me to be outside on adventures as supposed to playing computer games. As an adult, I drifted away from my former self and found myself in some really hard times. One day, I was having a garage sale, when I came across this book and seeing it once again brought me to tears.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I found myself back out in the open, not questioning those hard times. They just seemed to melt away.</p>

        <h2>Why you should get outdoors</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>It's no secert that exploring the great outdoors does wonders for your mental health. A hit of dopamine (a chemical released in the brain that makes you feel good) does wonders for the soul.</p>
        <p>The simple act of going outside, listening to birdsong and absorbing your surroundings is good for the heart and good for the mind.</p>

        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Our aim is simply to encourage people to breath in what's around them. Whether that's a simple stroll along the canal, an obstacle race or climbing a mountain.</p>
        <p>We hope you find our site useful, as it contains some trusted and tested gear for getting outside, our personal favourite walks for you to try, and a contact page should you need assistance for getting outside.</p>
