                    <p>Wonder Walkers is an organisation helping to get people exploring the great outdoors, once again.
                        The
                        organisation was inspired by the book, <a

                        Growing up as a child, the book inspired me to be outside on adventures as supposed to playing
                        computer games. As an adult, I drifted away from my former self and found myself in some really
                        hard
                        times. One day, I was having a garage sale, when I came across this book and seeing it once
                        again
                        brought me to tears.
                        Suddenly, I found myself back out in the open, not questioning those hard times.</p>

                    <p>It's no secert that exploring the great outdoors does wonders for your mental health. A hit of
                        dopamine (a chemical released in the brain that makes you feel good) does wonders for the soul.
                        The simple act of going outside, listening to birdsong and absorbing your surroundings is good
                        for
                        the heart and good for the mind.</p>
